    programming or coding is the
     composition of sequences of instructions, called programs, that computers can follow to
      perform tasks.<sup>[1][2]</sup> It involves designing and implementing algorithms, step-by-step 
      specifications of procedures, by writing code in one or more programming languages. 
      Programmers typically use high-level programming languages that are more easily 
      intelligible to humans than machine code, which is directly executed by the central
       processing unit. Proficient programming usually requires expertise in several different
        subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, details of programming languages
         and generic code libraries,
     specialized algorithms, and formal logic.</span>

        Auxiliary tasks accompanying and related to programming include 
        analyzing requirements, testing, debugging (investigating and fixing problems), 
        implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such as programs' 
        machine code. While these are sometimes considered programming, often the term software 
        development is used for this larger overall process 
        with the terms programming, implementation,
         and coding reserved for the writing and editing of code per se. Sometimes software development is 
         known as software engineering, especially when it employs formal methods or
         follows an engineering design process.</p>
