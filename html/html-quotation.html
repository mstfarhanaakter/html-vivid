    <p>Here is the code from wikipedia</p>
  <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code">
      The process of 
      encoding converts information from a
       source into symbols for communication 
      or storage. Decoding is the reverse process,
       converting code symbols back into a form 
        that the recipient understands, 
      such as English or/and Spanish.

<p> Other examples of prefix codes are country calling codes, 
  the country and publisher parts of ISBNs, and the Secondary
   Synchronization Codes used in the UMTS WCDMA 3G Wireless Standard.

    Kraft's inequality characterizes the
     sets of codeword lengths that are
      possible in a prefix code. <br><br>
      <q>Virtually 
      any uniquely decodable one-to-many code, 
      not necessarily a prefix one, must satisfy Kraft's inequality.
